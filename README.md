## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. RAG is a framework that combines the strengths of pre-trained language models with external knowledge sources to generate more informative, accurate, and contextually relevant responses.

**Key Features:**

* **Document Loading:** Supports loading documents from various sources (e.g., PDF, text files, web pages).
* **Indexing and Retrieval:** Implements efficient indexing techniques (e.g., using vector databases like ChromaDB, FAISS) to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.
* **Generation with Language Models:** Leverages powerful language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3/4, Hugging Face Transformers) to generate responses conditioned on the retrieved context.
* **Customizable Pipelines:** Designed with modular components, allowing for easy customization of the document loading, indexing, retrieval, and generation stages.
* **[Optional: Add any other specific features of your project, e.g., specific data sources, evaluation metrics, UI, etc.]**

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the RAG system on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **[Optional: List any specific software or services required, e.g., API keys for language models, database installations, etc.]**

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **(Note:** Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python packages. You can generate one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the dependencies.)

### Configuration

* **API Keys:** If your project uses external APIs (e.g., OpenAI), you might need to set up API keys as environment variables or in a configuration file. Refer to the specific documentation for those integrations.
* **Data Sources:** Configure the paths to your knowledge base documents or the connection details for your data sources.
* **Vector Database:** If you're using a vector database, you might need to start the database server or configure its connection parameters.

    **(Example: Mention environment variables)**

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

### Usage

Provide clear and concise instructions on how to run your RAG system. Include examples if possible.

```python
# Example Python usage (if applicable)
from your_module import RAGSystem

rag_system = RAGSystem(config_path="config.yaml") # Example configuration
response = rag_system.generate_response("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
